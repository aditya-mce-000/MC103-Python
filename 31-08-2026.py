# str = 'Python'

# print(str[-3:])
# print(str[:-2])

# print(str[::2])
# How It Works
# Python uses slice syntax in the format [start:end:step].
# The start defaults to the beginning of the string (index 0).
# The end defaults to the end of the string.
# The step value of 1 means it moves forward by one character at a time, keeping the entire string unchanged.

# str = 'Hello World'
# print(str[::-1])

# How It Works
# The expression [::-1] uses Python's extended slicing syntax, which follows the format [start:stop:step]
# start is omitted, so it defaults to the end of the string when the step is negative.
# stop is omitted, so it goes all the way to the beginning of the string.
# step is set to -1, which tells Python to traverse the string backward, one character at a time.

# As a result, the entire string is reversed.

# line = 'Python is  a programming language.'
# print(line.split(' '))
# print(line.replace('i','z'))
# print(line.swapcase())
# print(line.find('i'))

# Strings are immutable.
